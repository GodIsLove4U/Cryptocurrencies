# Cryptocurrencies
Unsupervised Machine Learning

This module provided us with the opportunity to learn more about using unsupervised machine learning models. We used a variety models and brought in dependencies to run our code. Working with the cryptocurrency data, we cut the information in half after removing null values and currency that was not being traded. Finally, we cleansed the data and changed some information to numeric values in order to run the data thru our models. Now, we have a finished product to show Martha's CEO and decisionmakers so they can take another look at cryptocurrency and determine how to move forward.
