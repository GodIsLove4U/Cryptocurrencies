# Cryptocurrencies
Unsupervised Machine Learning

This module provided us with the opportunity to learn more about using unsupervised machine learning models. We used a variety models and brought in dependencies to run our code. Working with the cryptocurrency data, we cut the information in half after removing null values and currency that was not being traded. Finally, we cleansed the data and changed some information to numeric values in order to run the data thru our models. Now, we have a finished product to show Martha's CEO and decisionmakers so they can take another look at cryptocurrency and determine how to move forward.

This challenge required the creation of three dataframes which were later combined after containing the data needed for analysis. Each table served a different purpose. The crypto dataframe had the original columns in the dataset, with exception of the trading information, which was dropped after it was clean. Then, we created a separate dataframe to hold the coin names. Following, we created a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) table to hold the data that was used to breakdown all of the cryptocurrencies. After processing, cleaning, translating and breaking apart the data, it was combined in a new dataframe to run the plots. Though there is not a large amount of code, there are a lot of moving parts and important steps to successfully complete the project. Happy coding!
